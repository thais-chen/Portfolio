            <h3 class="display-5"> 
                Student UX/UI designers want case studies for their portfolios, but struggle to find other design projects to collaborate on outside of the classroom.
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Our goal with Designer Connector is to address the problem budding designers have in regard to creating high-quality case studies. We created an online platform that facilitates ideation sessions and team formation between designers. Users can access design topics including website and mobile app redesigns, startup concepts, and design challenges. They can brainstorm and sketch ideas for their topic of interest on an online collaborative whiteboard, and see brainstorms from other designers to gain insight into how other people approach a design problem. Users can also reach out to and collaborate with other users on the platforms so they can collaborate on design projects together.

                <h3>Prototype Session One</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    For the first iteration of our Designer Connector prototype, our team decided to use piggyback prototyping working off of FigJam to help simulate designers discovering design topics that they are interested in, having them contribute to a collaborative brainstorming process with other interested designers and lastly having them form teams for the desired design topic and project roles that they are interested in. We decided to use FigJam because of its ability to allow multiple users to remotely collaborate synchronously on a project. This functionality was important because we wanted designers to have the opportunity to see how other designers work through the brainstorming process and be able to give feedback and reviews on each other’s ideas to also help them get a sense of potential members they’d like to form a team with.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        For our FigJam Prototype, we decided to create a brainstorming process that focuses on having designers sketch their design ideas out based on provided topics that were provided by our team. We came up with five topics which all required the designers to come up with ideas for specified topics such as designing a dog-walking app or redesigning the Canvas website.

                <p>We had designers rotate through four rounds so that each group of designers can create sketches for all four topics. Each round was timed so that designers only had two minutes to get their ideas down. After the rounds of sketches were completed, we had all designers take some time to review each other’s work and leave heart stamps for the ideas they found interesting.</p>

                    After having designers reflect on and review each other’s designs, we then proceeded onto the team formation part of the prototype that was conducted on Google Sheets. Here we gave designers the freedom to sign-up for their desired topic and project roles on their own.

                <p>
                    For the second iteration of the Designer Connector prototype, we made improvements based on the feedback we received from the first round of prototyping. For this improved version, we kept the design brainstorm concept fairly the same; however, major changes were made to the layout of the brainstorming process and we also included a better design topic basis for designers to work off of rather than having them come up with entirely new design concepts. We changed the layout of the prototype for the sake of organization purposes so groups of designers know exactly where they need to go and which topic they would need to be working on. We also cut down the number of rounds from 4 to 3 and also focused on 3 design topics that required participants to redesign a specific website with a purpose in mind such as redesigning Craigslist for easier navigation.

                <p>
                    Instead of having designers sketch out their ideas from scratch, for this version we decided to base the design topics on real websites and provided designers with screenshots of a webpage for them to mark up and make comments on for them to indicate their brainstorming ideas. Providing them with a screenshot of a webpage to work off of, allows the designers to pinpoint exactly where on the page they want to make the redesign changes and explain their idea with FigJam’s comment feature.

                    <p style> After the brainstorming session was completed, we then had designers move on to the team formation section of our
                        prototype. Here we used Discord to simulate a live voice chat feature so that participants could join chats based on
                        their design topic of interest, network with other interested designers, and ultimately end up forming teams and
                        settling on project roles after getting to know each other more. For the purpose of this prototyping session, we
                        capped the number of participants that could enter a voice channel so that teams would be even and designers could
                        see if their first choice in design topic or role is taken and would have to move on to their second choice. </p>

                    <p> 
                    Lastly, after having designers talk amongst themselves on Discord, we then had them go onto a Google Sheet to sign up for their desired teams and project roles that they should have discussed with other members in the voice chats. For purposes of promoting further communication between formed teams, we had designers include their e-mail address information so that they could contact their respective team members on their own afterward.

                            Based on the results of the previous two prototyping sessions, our team was able to use the data collected from feedback to create an actual prototype of our website on Figma. Our vision for Designer Connector is for it to be a website that designers use to discover design topics, brainstorm their ideas, collaborate with other designers, and ultimately use to help them form teams to work on a design project of their interest.

                            Users will be required to create an account to use the website. By requiring users to create accounts, we reduce the number of trolls on the website and promote interaction and collaboration with other users.

Surveys sought to uncover the effectiveness of our prototype in a) helping groups brainstorm and decide on a topic to work on and b) forming teams with other students. We also wanted to identify pain points and areas of confusion so that we could improve our prototype.

                            Overall, we received positive responses to our prototype. Participants indicated that brainstorming for different topics on Figjam helped them rapidly produce ideas and decide what topic they wanted to do. Notably, users expressed that being able to see other peoples’ ideas and brainstorms was helpful and provided useful insight into how to approach a design problem.

                    Students are eager to collaborate with each other but have trouble getting the ball rolling and expressing their ideas. Designer Connector aims to bring together individuals with the interest of collaborating on a project together, by helping them choose an appropriate role and brainstorm creative ideas through sketching and commenting on ideas with like-minded designers. We do not know if people will have a pleasant experience collaborating with their group mates, whether issues will arise, or if they will all contribute equally to the project. However, civilized discussion amongst group mates is likely to lead to a peaceful resolution, and active practice in resolving conflicts will strengthen one’s ability to work in a group. Designer Collector remains a solid resource for those looking to find others to collaborate with on design projects.
