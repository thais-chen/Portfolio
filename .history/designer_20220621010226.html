                Student UX/UI designers want case studies for their portfolios, but struggle to find other design projects to collaborate on outside of the classroom.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Collaboration is a vital part of the design process because different perspectives and backgrounds can contribute to an exceptional outcome in a collaborative environment. However, we’ve all faced our fair share of problems when it comes to team formation. There are a lot of challenges that people must overcome, whether it’s organizational, personal values, or how a process is conducted. With our team being all designers, we identified a common problem we all experienced; having difficulty forming teams with other people to create high-quality design projects. Our goal is to develop a platform that enables designers to collaborate with each other on high-quality design projects. Working collaboratively is a big part of what a designer does, and it leads to valuable connections that can help designers advance their careers.
