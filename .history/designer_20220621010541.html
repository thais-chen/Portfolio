                Student UX/UI designers want case studies for their portfolios, but struggle to find other design projects to collaborate on outside of the classroom.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Collaboration is a vital part of the design process because different perspectives and backgrounds can contribute to an exceptional outcome in a collaborative environment. However, we’ve all faced our fair share of problems when it comes to team formation. There are a lot of challenges that people must overcome, whether it’s organizational, personal values, or how a process is conducted. With our team being all designers, we identified a common problem we all experienced; having difficulty forming teams with other people to create high-quality design projects. Our goal is to develop a platform that enables designers to collaborate with each other on high-quality design projects. Working collaboratively is a big part of what a designer does, and it leads to valuable connections that can help designers advance their careers.

                Our goal with Designer Connector is to address the problem budding designers have in regard to creating high-quality case studies. We created an online platform that facilitates ideation sessions and team formation between designers. Users can access design topics including website and mobile app redesigns, startup concepts, and design challenges. They can brainstorm and sketch ideas for their topic of interest on an online collaborative whiteboard, and see brainstorms from other designers to gain insight into how other people approach a design problem. Users can also reach out to and collaborate with other users on the platforms so they can collaborate on design projects together.
