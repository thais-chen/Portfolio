            <hr>

            <h3 class="display-5">
                "We aim to create a sustainable environment by encouraging students to recycle food through the reward
                system and the online community on our App"
            </h3>
        </div>

            <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <p>
                From our secondary research, we concluded that people are more likely to recycle under these
                circumstances: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.Their friends, families, or roommates are implementing recycling practices in their lives </li>
                <li>2.Some sort of reward system is in place to encourage and motivate them. </li>
                <li>3. Recycling is made not as troublesome or complicated. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Thus, our proposed solution is to create a platform where users are encouraged to recycle food waste
                through mini-game features, reward systems, and community involvement.

            <p>
                The image above demonstrated our original brainstorming process with what our basic wireframe
                would look like. There would be four main sections that correspond to our proposed solution -- an
                interactive feature, a reward system, a community platform, and a profile frame.

            <span>
                <p> We decided to separate the community/rank frames into two for a cleaner experience.
                    Moreover, we also included a menus tab where the user can find each main frame for better
                    navigation.</p>

            <h1>User Testing of Lo-fi Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                To test the flow and the concept of our prototype, we asked an user to complete a set of general
                tasks and answer some questions. Since it is only our lo-fi prototype, these tasks and questions are
                more general so that we can gain a better understanding of the entire project as a whole.

                <br>
                The lo-fi prototype user testing is conducted during studio with another team. The user shared their
                screen and we instructed them to perform certain tasks. The user gave their feedback verbally so we
                had the comments written down in this file. We also observed the user’s action and noted what
                aspects they had trouble with.
            </p>

                <li>
                    1. Scan: Complete the “mini-game” by clicking through the prototype.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Garden: Go through the garden and reward system.

                <li>
                    3. Community and Rank: Switch between community and ranking; understand that users can
                    create posts, leave comments, and give likes.

                </li>

                <li>

                <li>
                    • Are there any sections or pages that don't flow well?

                </li>
                <li>
                    • Does the concept of the app make sense? Will you use it?

                    • Which features will you use/not use?

                </li>
                <li>
                    • Are there any features that you think we can benefit from including or excluding?

            <h2> Feedback: </h2>

                    <li>
                        ◦ Unsure whether to scan an image of the food waste or what until she clicked on the
                        screen to see the stimulation.

                    </li>
                    <li>◦ Suggests to rephrase the “scan” like "upload an image” because scan reminds her of
                        scanning a barcode.</li>
                    <li>◦ Love the interactivity. Much cooler if you actually drag into the bin rather than clicking to
                        stimulate.</li>
                    <li>◦ Thought the interactivity is interesting, but does not tell her a lot about exactly how to
                        recycle.</li>

                    <li>
                        ◦ Understand the concept based on my explanation but the prototype itself does not
                        seem to deliver that.

                    <li>
                        ◦ Consider adding more pages to make it clear what the garden is.

                Summary and Insights:
            </h2>
            <p>
                First, we will provide more information about our garden and reward system. This can clear any
                confusion of how the garden works and how a user can get points. Also, by making the reward
                system clear, we believe it will attract more users
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, we want to enhance our garden feature by making it clear that points were gained. This
                might boost the feeling of accomplishment for the user’s experience. Based on our feedback, it
                seems that the game is a “cute idea” and that it is fun to “keep your friends accounted for.” Thus, we
                want to focus on enhancing our interactive and garden features to make it more appealing.
                Lastly, we want to polish up the lo-fi prototype by including images, color and icons.

            <ul>
                <li>
            ◦  Create an information page about how the garden works.
                </li>
                <li>
                ◦ Include info on how to get points and what the points meant.

                </li>
                <li> ◦ Create an information page on how the reward system operates.


                </li>
                <li>
                ◦ Include info on what are the rewards and how to get the rewards.

                </li>
                <li>
            ◦ Create bubbles in the garden feature for the user to click on so that they understand they have
                received the points.

                </li>
                <li>
            ◦ Redesign the garden feature to make it more aesthetically appealing.

                </li>
                <li>
            ◦ Include color, images, and icons based on our style guide and mood board.

                All of our interviewees completed Task 1 smoothly, commenting that the flow is fluent and easy to
                follow. For Task 2, interviewees who had previous experience with growing a tree (or similar
                experience of feeding a digital pet) completed the task with ease, while interviewees encountering the
                feature for the first time needed more time reading the instructions. However, all interviewees had no
                trouble completing the task once reading the description provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the interview questions, we received positive feedback regarding the clarity and ease of use
                of the prototype. The suggestion for improvement of our scanning function is mostly about the
                programming part, where they wish to be able to actually drag the item into the correct bin rather than
                stimulating the action. We received especially positive feedback for the garden and reward feature, as
                all of our interviewees commented that the reward system is very attractive and interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                For improvement, we received suggestions for increasing the variety of rewards to increase incentive.
                Also making the app more educational by increasing the information presented after scanning,
                including but not limited to a description for why a trash goes to which bin and how recycling can
                influence the environment.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <div class="textStyle">
        <p>From our high-fi user testing session, we recognized that our scanning interactive feature can be
            easily carried out. The garden and reward system is said to be appealing and motivational for
            continuous use. However, one user commented that the garden feature was initially confusing but the
            information page helped to clear the confusion </p>
        <p>
            If we have more time to improve our prototype, our main task is to include a section where we provide
            educational guidelines for proper recycling practices. Other changes, as mentioned before, are to
            implement a dragging function for our interactive features and provide a more diverse range of
            rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Possible future plans would be to implement our platform as an app. This would allow the user to
            actually use the scanning camera function. Moreover, we can also test the usability of the community
            system and the garden feature.
